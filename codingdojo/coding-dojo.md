Women in Tech Scholarship Essay

The idea behind diversity in big tech companies is making sure the company stays innovative. Diversity in any situation - be it in a biological, financial, mythical, etc., usually benefits all parties. And innovation means to progress and it means profits.

In a TED talk by Melody Hobson, the President of Ariel Investments, she urges companies nationally to be “color brave”, and not “color blind”. Ultimately, Hobson is urging that all companies act brave enough to acknowledge that racial and gender inequalities exist (especially in tech companies, obviously) and that they need to get about trying to fix those discrepancies. The same idea can be applied to the gender gap in these top tech companies as well.

This question is personal. I recognize myself as a mature Hispanic female majoring in Computer Science who has traveled extensively and has experienced or seen first-hand acts of misogyny and racism in all facets of our tiny earth. I'm well aware at this point in my life that misogyny in whatever region always tarnishes that region's image and costs that region's economy more than people are aware of. It damages the sympathy of those who have to undergo it as well, and the harmful process ends up looking like a figure 8, infinite in nature and never-ending.

Even so, I'm hopeful. Google, along with a few other giant tech industries, has already decided to take a step forward in the aspect of diversity. Diversity in hiring makes for a wider range of ideas or and it's inclusive of more and more people every day.

I feel as though this issue of diversity has started to surface more recently. Perhaps the companies realize they're going to have to make sure their products appeal to a wider consumer base and expand their startup portfolios to include more minorities. It all comes down to not just diversity, then, but diversity based on perspective. If tech giants don't increase diversity, if they simply overlook the fact that everyone looks the same and casually cast it aside, they will suffer financially and in terms of their brand appeal to minority consumers (e.g., U2 album and Apple). That's diversity in perspective.

The problem then comes down to perception. Thanks to the bro culture that is so ever present in tech, many women will feel out-of-place and stigmatized, marginalized, or even overtly sexualized. The news tells us this is happening all the time in places like the Valley and women listen. They listen and they think to themselves, "no way am I going into tech if that's going to happen to me".

Once we solve this problem of perception as companies strive to increase diversity, future generations of women and minorities will have the opportunity to feel no hesitation or doubt when they decide they want to enter the tech industry and the world will be a better place because more people will make a difference.
