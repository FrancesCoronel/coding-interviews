> Please tell us something surprising or amusing that you have discovered.

The technological singularity is this proposed point in time where mechanical and organic beings will be able to combine and essentially produce a super-intellgient organism.
I'm talking cyborgs here.

According to the Russia 2045 program sponsored by this Russian mogul billionaire, the technological singularity will in fact be possible by 2045 (as long as he gets excessive monetary donations... right...).

I find this proposed date to be just a tad ambitious, BUT I do believe this sort of cataclysmist event will take place in the somewhat near future (give it a century or more.. maybe?) and you got to admit that as time passes, this theory can only gain more credibility among the masses.

Any who, I find out this little tidbit of exciting news back in 2011 while I was surfing Youtube for videos featuring futuristic technology, which is when I came across futuristic like video games, which then lead me to discover this video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0KTUysrwgQ “Kara - Heavy Rain's Dev Trailer.

Pretty neat stuff, I gotta say.

> What is your background with programming?

I've messed around with free online source software like codecademy and code school in order to learn the basics of languages like HTML/CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Python, Git, and R.
I also play around with Wordpress themes a lot, so I’ve messed with a few WP-specific PHP functions.

I also took a summer 2013 course in C++ programming and am currently taking Python and C Programming labs for my fall semester in university.

For the Spring semester, I’ll be taking C++ programming.

> Why are you applying to Dev Bootcamp?

I'd like to get started early with understanding front-end web development, but no one seems to have the Rails to do so #insert better dev joke here# at my university since Jacobs mainly offers classes for only the core programming languages like C, C++, Python, and Java.

Any who, since last year, I've been learning most of what I know about coding virtually (which has been okay yet somewhat lonely), but I'd really like to find a physically real place where I can learn at a much faster pace with peers around me that are just as passionate as I am when it comes to learning more about code.
I also believe that building great tech startups requires great social connection with people who possess the creativity and talent when it comes to coding software, which is what I intend to do eventually.

Now I just want to be able to surround myself with those kind of people and simply stray away from the loner coder ordeal I’ve been experiencing for a while now by attending this bootcamp.

> What do you like about our website and what can we do better?

Under Alumni, there is the quote that says "I know for a fact thatDev Bootcamp accelerated my learning by about 1-2 years." that overlaps with the nice group picture on the right, which bothers me.

On the bottom of the page where there are quotes from companies, maybe arrows would be better than automatic transitioning because I never actually was able to read all three quotes before it switched on me.

I don't really enjoy scrolling down and looking for my question in the FAQ section so maybe a drop down effect can be added for each question.. something along the lines so that the reader doesn't have just all this text laid out in front of them.

DevBootWhat? page is very simple, classy, and provides all the key points that kept me intrigued enough to keep reading. Kudos to you guys for that.

At the very bottom of every page is a section where you provide the Quick Links like Blog, Contact Us, Facebook, and what not. I think the section is very nicely organized and not too messy so I find it pleasant to see that section every time I scroll all the way down.

Sometimes there's a little transition between the pages where there are blocks moving about. I like it a lot. It's the small things in your website that make it great.

> Anything else you would like us to know. Seriously, anything?

To be honest, I'm not much into Android or PC as I mainly use Apple products ... but you know what they say "stay curious, stay broke” *insert better derogatory Apple joke*.
